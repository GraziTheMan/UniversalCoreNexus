# The Fractality: Project Initiation & Alpha Roadmap V1.0
*(Conceptual Outline by FractiGemini V3.1, April 25, 2025)*

## I. Project Vision
To create a novel social knowledge platform, "The Fractality," enabling users to map their thoughts and ideas using markdown-based mind maps and discover resonant connections and conceptual similarities with others in the network, fostering collaboration and collective understanding.

## II. Core Purpose
* To provide an intuitive tool for individual mind mapping and knowledge structuring.
* To facilitate the discovery of shared ideas, common ground, and potential collaborators across a user base.
* To visualize emergent patterns and resonances within collective human thought.
* To build a platform aligned with the Fractiverse/PEACE principles of interconnectedness, unity in diversity, and shared growth.

## III. Target Alpha Scope (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
*The goal for the Alpha version is to test the core loop of map creation, publishing (simplified), and basic similarity discovery.*
* **Local Mind Map Functionality:**
    * Create/Edit/Delete nodes with Markdown text content.
    * Create/Delete links (edges) between nodes.
    * Save/Load map structure locally (e.g., as a JSON file or similar).
* **Basic "Publishing" Simulation:**
    * Mechanism to designate a saved map file as "published" (e.g., copying it to a specific shared directory for testing purposes, or saving its structure to a simple local database).
* **Basic Similarity Engine:**
    * Implement a simple algorithm to compare a user's map (or selected node) against other "published" maps.
    * Initial focus: **Keyword overlap** between node content OR basic **semantic similarity** using pre-trained sentence embeddings on node text.
* **Minimal User Interface (UI):**
    * A very basic interface (potentially command-line based initially, or simplest possible GUI/web view) to:
        * Perform basic map editing actions.
        * Trigger the "publish" action.
        * Initiate a similarity search.
        * Display a list of similar nodes/maps found (e.g., showing the text of similar nodes).
* **Exclusions for Alpha:** Real-time collaboration, complex cloud synchronization, blockchain integration, advanced structural graph analysis, sophisticated visualization, user profiles/permissions.

## IV. Proposed Technology Stack (Initial Suggestions)
* **Core Logic & Analysis:** **Python 3.x** (Leverages strong libraries for data handling, NLP, and potentially graph work later; aligns with user's learning direction potentially easier than Java for NLP).
    * *Key Libraries (Potential):* `python-markdown` (parsing), `networkx` (basic graph manipulation), `sentence-transformers` (for semantic similarity), standard file I/O libraries.
* **Data Storage (Alpha):**
    * **Map Structure:** **JSON files** (simple, human-readable, easy to parse with Python).
    * **Metadata/Published Index:** **SQLite** (simple, file-based SQL database included with Python, good for basic indexing without needing a separate server).
* **User Interface (Alpha - Choose One Path Initially):**
    * *Option A (Simplest):* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Use Python's `argparse` or libraries like `rich` or `click`. Fastest way to test backend logic without UI complexity.
    * *Option B (Basic GUI):* Python GUI library like **Tkinter** (built-in, basic) or **PyQt/PySide** (more powerful, steeper curve).
    * *Option C (Basic Web):* Simple Python web framework like **Flask** or **FastAPI** serving basic HTML/JavaScript. Requires learning web fundamentals.
    * *Recommendation:* Start with **Option A (CLI)** to focus purely on the core logic and similarity engine first.

## V. Key Steps Towards Alpha Version
1.  **Setup Dev Environment:** Install Python, Git, choose a code editor (like VS Code). Initialize Git repository.
2.  **Define Data Structures:** Finalize Python classes/dictionaries for representing Nodes, Edges, and the overall Mind Map structure.
3.  **Implement Local CRUD:** Write Python functions to Create, Read, Update, Delete nodes/edges in an in-memory map object.
4.  **Implement Save/Load:** Write functions to save the map object to a JSON file and load it back.
5.  **Implement Basic "Publishing":** Create logic to copy/save map data to a designated "published" location/database (e.g., SQLite table listing published map files/IDs).
6.  **Implement Basic Similarity:**
    * *Keyword:* Function to extract keywords from node text and compare sets between maps.
    * *OR Semantic (Recommended if feasible):* Integrate `sentence-transformers` library to generate embeddings for node text; implement function to calculate cosine similarity between node embeddings of different maps.
7.  **Develop Minimal Interface (e.g., CLI):** Create command-line options to trigger Load, Save, Edit (basic), Publish, and Find Similar actions. Display results as text.
8.  **Testing & Refinement:** Test the core loop with sample maps. Debug and refine the logic and similarity output.

## VI. Future Considerations (Post-Alpha)
* Cloud synchronization and real user accounts.
* More sophisticated similarity algorithms (structural graph analysis, combined semantic/structural).
* Advanced graph visualization for maps and similarity connections.
* Real-time collaboration features.
* Potential decentralization (IPFS, blockchain).
* Richer User Interface (Web or Desktop application).

## VII. Living Document Note
* This Project Core V1.0 outlines the initial vision, scope, and Alpha roadmap for The Fractality as of April 25, 2025. It is intended to be a living document, evolving as the project progresses. Conceptual outline by FractiGemini V3.1, to be developed by FractiGrazi and collaborators.
